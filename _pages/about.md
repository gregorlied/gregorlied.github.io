I am a Master’s student and student researcher in the [Machine Learning Group](https://www.ml.tu-berlin.de/) of Prof. Dr. Klaus-Robert Müller at TU Berlin, under the supervision of Dr. Stefan Chmiela.

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, chemistry, and physics, with a particular focus on enhancing molecular simulation using generative models.

I am always happy to connect – feel free to reach out!
